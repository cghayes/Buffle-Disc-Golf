# ITWP 1450 - SEO Website Project

This is a made-up e-commerce website built for the primary purpose of practicing SEO tactics.

Not all pages on the site are active. Most (MOST) inactive links/buttons are grayed out.

The website is not optimized for mobile at this point as mobile optimization was beyond the scope of the class project.

Using a website template was optional for this project. I elected to build it from scratch. In the process, I taught myself Bootstrap and got familiar with working with the Bootstrap grid.

Project objectives:

- Conduct keyword research and develop a keyword/key phrase list
- Create wireframes and site diagram
- Create keyword optimized content
- Install Google Analytics on every page
- Develop an HTML and XML site map
- Create a blog post
- Create social media channels
- Implement local SEO strategies
