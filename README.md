# ITWP 1450 - SEO Website Project

This is a made-up e-commerce website built for the primary purpose of practicing SEO tactics.

Not all pages on the site are active. Most (MOST) inactive links/buttons are grayed out.

The website is not optimized for mobile at this point as mobile optimization was beyond the scope of the class project.

Using a website template was optional for this project. I elected to build it from scratch. In the process, I taught myself Bootstrap and got familiar with working with the Bootstrap grid.
