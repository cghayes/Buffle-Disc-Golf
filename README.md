ITWP 1450 SEO Website Project

This is a made-up e-commerce website built for the primary purpose of practicing SEO tactics.

Not all pages on the site are active. Most inactive links/buttons are grayed out.

Using a website template was optional for this project. I elected to build it from scratch. In the process, I taught myself Bootstrap and got familiar with working with the Bootstrap grid.

Images were sourced from stock image websites such as Pixabay or Unsplash. Disc product images sourced from Discraft's resources page: https://www.team.discraft.com/resources.
